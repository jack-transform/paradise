# Paradise

Code for an experiment integrating GPT-3 with the Ensemble social physics engine to create a simulation-game themed around **Bachelor In Paradise**.

Poor architectural decisions on my part and existing problems inherited from Ensemble made authoring a complex simulation quite difficult, so this project was shelved in favor of other research directions.

Note that since switching from the deprecated "text-davinci-003" to "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", conversation performance has substantial degraded.
