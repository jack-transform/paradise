# Paradise

Code for an experiment integrating GPT-3 with the Ensemble social physics engine to create a simulation-game themed around **Bachelor In Paradise**.

Poor architectural decisions on my part and existing problems inherited from Ensemble made authoring a complex simulation quite difficult, so this project was shelved in favor of other research directions.
